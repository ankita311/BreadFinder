Hey Ankita,
You've debugged the errors, sorted the logic, and maybe even aced your DSA round.
But when it comes to your internship plan, things still feel... fuzzy?
You're not alone.
In college, figuring out what to do next isn't always about having the right answers, it's about asking the right people.
That's where mentorship helps!!
Talk to someone who's faced the same career questions and figured it out...
Get clarity on where to apply
Receive honest resume feedback
Learn strategies that actually work
Book your mentorship session now
Smart move. Especially before placement season kicks in.

Seems like a lot, right?
But instead of taking pressure, ('cause you're not a pressure cooker) let's work towards your goals together. Because remember. One last year of college to enjoy before you either jump into higher education, a job, or a startup.
